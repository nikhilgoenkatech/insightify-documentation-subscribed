# Other use-cases
Whilst the extension generates the metrics and plot these onto the dashboard, there are some other features that you can leverage by doing additional configuration

## Know your generated metrics  
Extension will create the following metrics (depending on your configuration) that can be leveraged

## Create Customized Benefits Valuation/Dashboard Reports  
Using the metrics available within the extension, create **customised dashboards** for showcasing Benefits Relisation. For example, using the problems data I created a dashboard as below that provides quick sneak peak into different aspects of Problems generated, RCA available, MTTR when RCA is available, etc.  
![benefits-realisation-rpt](Benefits_Realisation_Report.gif)  

## Dashboard Reports

End-user can subscribe to get the dashboard reports weekly or monthly. More details on how to can be found in our help [documentation link](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/dashboard-reports)  
![dashboard-report](dashboard_subscribe_report.png)

## Single value trend

Navigate to the `Data Explorer` screen for a specific metric and set expected thresholds for a specific metric. This can be powerful to get a quick view of say **MTTR**, etc.  
![threshold-view](dashboard_tile_threshold.png)
![threshold-view_1](dashboard_tile_threshold_2.png)

## Setting custom alerts

You can setup custom alerts on any of the generated metrics so as to be alerted for any abberations. This could be particularly useful for use-cases wherein you as an end-user would like a specific group to be notified once their consumption goes beyond a threshold. To setup a custom alert, navigate to **Settings > Anomaly Detection >> Custom events for alerting** and set the threshold.  
![custom-alert](custom_alert_mgmt_zone.gif)
![custom-alert](custom_alert_mgmt_zone_2.png)

In the above screenshot, a custom alert is setup for management zone `Cloud:AWS` to be alerted whenever the host consumption in endpoint `Non-prod` breaches 200.  

## Compare consumption or adoption metrics across different endpoints  
You can setup reports to compare adoption data or license data across different endpoints to give an overview how the different tenants are utlizing/adopting Dynatrace. To compare across tenants, navigate to **Data explorer** and split the metric(s) across different endpoints.

This can be further pinned back to the dashboard by clicking on **Pin to Dashboard**.
