### Look around

1. Navigate to Technologies and find metrics for your endpoint:  
   ![topology-view](topology_view_extension.png)

2. The Group page lets you analyze the group and view the performance of its members.  
   ![topology-view](topology_view.png)

3. Analyze various chart types on device page by navigating to the group instance (endpoint)

4. Lastly, multiple dashboards will be created (depending on your configuration) for each of the endpoint for a quick view of each endpoint.

   If you have enabled **Capture and report problem data per management zone**, an additional dashboard **Insightify: Incident Report: \<Endpoint-name\>** will be created.
